CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. In simple words, it tells the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. An example of CSS code is shown below:

body {
background-color: lightblue;
}
h1 {
color: white;
text-align: center;
}

Three Ways to Insert CSS

External style sheet
Internal style sheet
Inline style
Here’s how you would set your h2 element’s text color to blue using inline CSS:
<h2 style="color: blue;">Interns Pakistan</h2>

Your challenge:

Change the h1 element style so that its text color is “green” using inline CSS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:
A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:

The selector points to the HTML element/tag you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
In this example below <p> tag will be center-aligned, with a green text color:

p {
   color: green;
   text-align: center;
}

CSS selectors:
CSS selectors are used to “find” (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, and more. There are many kinds of selectors available in CSS such as:

Element Selector
ID Selector
Class Selector
Grouping Selectors

Element Selector:
The element selector selects elements based on the element name. For example, the <p> elements in below example has been styled to be center-aligned, with a green text color:

p {
   text-align: center;
   color: green;
}

ID Selector:
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The element should be unique within a page. To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. For example, to apply style to paragraph with id = “para”:

<p id="para">Test Example</p>

The following style rules be applied:

#para {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

Class Selector:
The class selector uses the class attribute of an HTML element to select a specific class element. The element have no conditions to be unique. To select an element with a specific class, write a hash (.) character, followed by the class name of the elements. For example, to apply style to paragraph with class = “para”:

<p class="para">Test Example</p>

The following style rules be applied:

.para {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
The rule will get applied to all the elements that has the class “para”.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fonts:
The CSS font properties define the font family, boldness, size, and the style of a text.

Font Family:
The font family of a text is set with the font-family property. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.

Note: If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: “Times New Roman”.

More than one font family is specified in a comma-separated list, example give below:

p {
   font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}

Font Style:
The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.

This property has three values:

normal – The text is shown normally
italic – The text is shown in italics
oblique – The text is “leaning” (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)
.normal {
  font-style: normal;
}

.italic {
  font-style: italic;
}

.oblique {
  font-style: oblique;
}

Font Size:
The font-size property sets the size of the text. Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs. Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1> – <h6> for headings and <p> for paragraphs.

Example: Setting the text size with pixels gives you full control over the text size:

h1 {
    font-size: 40px;
}
h2 {
    font-size: 30px;
}
p {
    font-size: 14px;
}

Font Weight:
The font-weight property specifies the weight of a font. It could either be bold or normal.

p.normal {
    font-weight: normal;
}
p.bold {
    font-weight: bold;
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorations:
Some of the most common decoration properties for text include:

Text Color
Text Alignment
Text Decoration
Text Transformation
Text Indentation
Letter Spacing
Line Height

Lets look into each property in detail with example.

Text Color:
The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:

a color name – like “red”
a HEX value – like “#ff0000”
an RGB value – like “rgb(255,0,0)”
The example below showcases the use of text color:

body {
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  color: green;
}

Text Alignment:
The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text. A text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified. The following example shows justify, center aligned, and left and right aligned text (left alignment is default if text direction is left-to-right, and right alignment is default if text direction is right-to-left):

div {
   text-align: justify;
}
h1 {
   text-align: center;
}
h2 {
   text-align: left;
}
h3 {
   text-align: right;
}

Text Decoration:
The text-decoration property is used to set or remove decorations from text. The value text-decoration: none; is often used to remove underlines from links. The other text-decoration values are used to decorate text such as overline, underline or line-through. The following example demonstrates how to use text decoration property:

a {
   text-decoration: none;
}
h1 {
   text-decoration: overline;
}
h2 {
   text-decoration: line-through;
}
h3 {
   text-decoration: underline;
}

Text Transformation:
The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text. It can be used to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each word. The following example demonstrates how to use text-transform property for a paragraph.

p.uppercase {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

p.lowercase {
  text-transform: lowercase;
}

p.capitalize {
  text-transform: capitalize;
}

Text Indentation:
The text-indent property is used to specify the indentation of the first line of a text. The following example demonstrates how to define a indentation of the first line of a text.

p {
  text-indent: 50px;
}

Letter Spacing:
The letter-spacing property is used to specify the space between the characters in a text. The following example demonstrates how to increase or decrease the space between characters:

h1 {
  letter-spacing: 3px;
}

h2 {
  letter-spacing: -3px;
}

Line Height:
The line-height property is used to specify the space between lines. The following example demonstrates how to define a line height for a paragraph:

p.small {
  line-height: 0.8;
}
p.big {
  line-height: 1.8;
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Positioning
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky). There are five different position values:

static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky

We will only be looking at the relative position.

position: relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

Here is the CSS that is used:

div.relative {   
   position: relative;   	
   left: 30px;   
   border: 3px solid #73AD21; 
}

Your Challenge:

Set “paper.gif” as the background image of the page.

Solution Syntax:
body { background-image:url(imagename.png) }

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your Challenge:

Set “gradient_bg_vertical.png” as the background image of the page, and repeat it vertically only.
Use individual properties only

Hint:
Use both properties separately i.e. background-image and background-repeat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

Instead of writing:

body {
background-color: #ffffff;
background-image: url("img_tree.png");
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: right top;
}

You can use the shorthand property background:

body {
background: #ffffff url("imagename.png") no-repeat right top;
}

When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

(C-I-R-A-P)
background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value.

Your Challenge:

Use the shorthand background property to
Set background image to “img_tree.png“,
Show it once (i.e. don’t repeat),
Position it to top right corner.
Follow the order as defined above.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your Challenge:

Use the margin property to center align the h1 element.

Hint:

Use margin property along with auto. Example: margin: auto

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your Challenge:

Use the padding property to set the top and bottom paddings for paragraph to “25px“, and left and right paddings to “50px“.

Hint:

Use padding property only. Example: padding: 25px 0px;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your Challenge:

Remove the underline from the link that has the id “mainlink“.

Solution:

#mainlink {
	text-decoration: none;
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your Challenge:

Style text in <h1> to uppercase letters, and text in <p> to capitalized letters.

Hint:

Use text-transform property.
